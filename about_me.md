This is my personal page, built using the *Contrast* theme by [Niklas Buschmann](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast).

I write about applied machine learning and engineering — especially the parts
that become interesting once systems leave the notebook and face real-world
constraints.

My current focus areas include ML & GenAI engineering, natural language
processing, and applied statistics, with a particular interest in stochastic
systems and, when time permits, computational social science. Most posts are
pragmatic in nature: small experiments, technical notes, and lightweight
blueprints derived from my own work.

This page is intentionally minimal and content-driven. Its purpose is to
document ideas, experiments, and observations in a concise and reproducible
form, written primarily for clarity and long-term reference rather than as a
polished portfolio or showcase.
