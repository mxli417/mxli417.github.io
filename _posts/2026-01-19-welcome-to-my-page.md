This is my personal developer blog — a place to collect thoughts, experiments,
and technical notes around machine learning, engineering, and the many things
that tend to break once theory meets reality.

My main interests currently revolve around:

- applied machine learning and MLOps  
- applied statistics and stochastic systems  
- computational social science (when time permits)  
- systems that appear simple but hide non-obvious complexity  
- reproducible setups, tooling, and engineering workflows  
- understanding *why* things fail, not just how to patch them  

The posts here range from small technical explorations to more structured
write-ups and blueprints that I use in my own work. They are intentionally
pragmatic, occasionally opinionated, and rarely polished — mostly notes I
wish I had come across earlier myself.

If you already know me, you might recognize this view from my home village.
If not, feel free to make a guess.
